### run delete branch

Safely deletes a local git branch after confirming it has been reviewed and merged.

**Steps:**

1. Check current branch:

   - Run `git branch --show-current` to see which branch you're on
   - Display the current branch name to the user

2. Ask for confirmation:

   - Ask the user: "Was this branch successfully reviewed and merged? If so, congratulations! 🎉 Please say 'Yes' if you'd like to delete this branch on your local machine now, as it's no longer needed. 'No' to cancel."
   - Wait for user response

3. If user confirms "Yes" (or similar affirmative response):

   - Ask which branch they want to delete (if not already clear from context)
   - If user wants to delete the current branch:
     - Switch to main branch first with `git checkout main`
     - Explain: "Switching to main first since you can't delete the branch you're currently on"

4. Delete the branch:
   - Run `git branch -d [branch-name]` to safely delete the branch
   - If deletion fails with error (branch not fully merged):
     - Inform user the branch may not be fully merged
     - Ask if they want to force delete with `git branch -D [branch-name]`
     - Only proceed with force delete if user explicitly confirms

<!-- #. Optional - Delete remote branch:

   - Ask user: "Would you also like to delete this branch from the remote repository?"
   - If yes, run `git push origin --delete [branch-name]`
   - Confirm successful deletion -->

5. Verify deletion:
   - Run `git branch` to show remaining local branches
   - Confirm the branch no longer appears in the list

**Important notes:**

- Always confirm the branch has been merged before deleting
- Use `-d` flag for safe deletion (prevents deleting unmerged branches)
- Use `-D` flag only when user explicitly confirms force deletion
- Cannot delete the currently checked out branch - must switch first
- Deleting local branch does NOT automatically delete the remote branch
- If branch wasn't merged, recommend pushing/merging before deletion
